; A sprite will be a 7x8 block, which corresponds to 32 bytes.  But given that
; it can be at any x-coordinate, we need to consider it to be a 14x8 block,
; 64 bytes.  We will pre-shift them so that we have these bytes ready to go.
; To put a sprite at an absolute y-coordinate on the screen requires taking
; the smooth scroll parameter into account.  If scroll is set to 2 and we
; want to put it on lines 5-C, then we have to start drawing on line 7.
;
; sprite line 0 - display line 5 - adjusted line 7
; sprite line 1 - display line 6 - adjusted line 0
; sprite line 2 - display line 7 - adjusted line 1
; sprite line 3 - display line 8 - adjusted line A
; sprite line 4 - display line 9 - adjusted line B
; sprite line 5 - display line A - adjusted line C
; sprite line 6 - display line B - adjusted line D
; sprite line 7 - display line C - adjusted line E
;
; That is, to draw on display line y, we draw to
; int(y/8) + (y+offset)%7
;
; To draw the sprite itself, we need to compute the targets and then move
; the data.  The data is 64 bytes, and we want to load the background, stash
; it somewhere, apply a mask, draw, and then store.  That's minimally
; in the ballpark of 1280 cycles per sprite, probably will be somewhat
; more.
